### E3Kit Android Java Sample
To use this sample you have to run this server locally first: [Sample Backend for Java](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/sample-backend-java).

After server is running - start current sample. If all works well - you will get Base64 string representation of encoded text on the screen.

Current demo is supposed to run in an emulator while server should be running the localhost:3000 address (10.0.2.2:3000 from emulator).
